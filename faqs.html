      <p>
        The Occupational English Test (OET) is an international English
        language test that assesses the language skills of healthcare
        professionals who wish to work abroad. The test is available for 12
        professions: dentistry, dietetics, medicine, nursing, occupational
        therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry, radiography,
        speech pathology, and veterinary science. OET is recognised by
        relevant regulatory healthcare agencies in Australia, New Zealand,
        UK, Ireland, USA, Canada, New Zealand, Dubai, Singapore, Namibia,
        and Ukraine. For more on OET, see

      I need to do OET. Where do I start?
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>
        Very important: start preparing early for your OET. Do not make the
        mistake of waiting until the last minute! A good idea is to do your
        preparation FIRST, then book your test date when you are confident
        of passing and are more likely to pass the FIRST TIME. But it’s okay
        to book the test first. In this case, we recommend a date two to
        three months away. This allows time to prepare properly without
        panic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are committed to doing OET, it’s good to do a quick
        placement test to know where best to start and what your strengths
        and weaknesses are. Then go to our OET Preparation page and choose
        your course(s). Our courses cover all the materials and skills you
        will need to prepare.

        Remember: registering for a course means you have access to the
        pre-set Live Group Classes! If Live Classes do not suit you, you can
        register for private tutoring.
